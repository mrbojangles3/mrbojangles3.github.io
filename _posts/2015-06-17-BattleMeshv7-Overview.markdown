# Battle Mesh
Sadly, it doesn't look like the organizers posted any results from their
expirements. They have a [github repository](https://github.com/battlemesh) and [youtube playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjdaTaDJvaVzotzdFSpblCVegRpHgGPLG) of some of the talks given. [UPC](www.ac.upc.edu) donated 20 [WRTnodes](www.wrtnode.com) for the event. 
There were about 60 confirmed attendees to the event. 

## What they Actually Did
As best I can tell they downloaded and ran the [wibed](http://wiki.confine-project.eu/wibed:start) on their hardware. The stated goal was to "run different routing protocols...perform some tests and see which routing protocol behaves better". Several of the participants were from the creators of the mesh protocols, I can only assume that they took the knowledge gained applied it to their codebases.
## What to look for in v8
Looks like more of the same, the venu will give options for indoor and outdoor
testing. There are 3 participants registered affiliated with cjdns It is taking place in Maribor, Slovenia.

## In the next blog post
A deep dive into cjdns. I will be running it on my wrtnode, laptop, and my old
router that is openwrt comaptible. Another possibility would be to use
containers on a local system.
